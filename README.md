# How to choose the best AirBnb accommodation in London?

Choosing a hotel in a city as large as London can be a difficult task. Even though we have several sites available such as Booking.com, Trivago and AirBnb, the choice is so wide that it is difficult to decide based on price and reviews alone. 
For this reason I thought it would be useful to have another parameter available that could facilitate the choice, that is, the level of safety of the various neighborhoods of London. 
Suppose you want to use the AirBnb platform to book the property.
It is important to know, in addition to the reliability of the host, prices and reviews, in which area of the city the structures are located and what the crime rate is in the area.
Therefore, the objective of this study is to provide a useful map for this choice, taking into account the geographical distribution of accommodation divided by type (private room or entire apartment), the average price per person and the crime rate in the various neighborhoods of the city of London.<br>
The project is divided into different phases:

* clarification of the sources of the data used;

* import of datasets;

* manipulation, descriptive analysis and graphic representation of the analyzed datasets and the results obtained;

* creation of an interactive map as a summary of previous analyses.

The project is developed in R.
The generated output is in HTML format, in order to preserve the interactivity of the final map.
